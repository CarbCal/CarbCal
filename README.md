## üöÄ How to Use

You can access the live application at: [https://lucamurdoch.github.io/CarbCal/](https://lucamurdoch.github.io/CarbCal/)

If you prefer to run it locally:


1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LucaMurdoch/CarbCal.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd CarbCal/WebApp
    ```
3.  **Configure API Keys (Optional):**
    For online food search functionality, you'll need to obtain API keys from Nutritionix. Edit `index.html` and replace `YOUR_APP_ID` and `YOUR_APP_KEY` with your actual keys.
    ```javascript
    const appId = 'YOUR_APP_ID';
    const appKey = 'YOUR_APP_KEY';
    ```
    If API keys are not configured, the application will automatically fall back to using the Open Food Facts API.
4.  **Open the application:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

## üîß Technical Details

CarbCal is built from the ground up using core web technologies, demonstrating efficient and framework-free development.

-   **DOM Manipulation:** The dynamic and interactive UI is powered entirely by vanilla JavaScript, which handles everything from calculations and UI updates to creating and managing elements on the fly.
-   **Browser `localStorage`:** All user data, including the list of saved food items and the selected theme (light/dark), is stored and retrieved using the browser's `localStorage` API. This ensures data persistence across sessions without needing a backend.
-   **`fetch` API for Asynchronous Operations:** The online search feature uses the native `fetch` API to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the Nutritionix and Open Food Facts APIs.
-   **Robust API Fallback Logic:** The application is designed for resilience. It first attempts to fetch data from the Nutritionix API. If this fails for any reason (e.g., API limits, network errors), it automatically and seamlessly falls back to the Open Food Facts API, ensuring the user can still get results.
-   **CSS3 for Styling and Animations:** The application is styled with modern CSS, including Flexbox for layout, custom properties for theming (light/dark modes), and keyframe animations for subtle, meaningful UI transitions.
